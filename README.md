#ModernCV plus

###Curriculum Vitae, Presentation Letter, and Resignation Letter.

The moderncv documentclass needs it's input to be formatted with regular commands like:

- \section
- \subsection
- \maketitle

But also defines its own special commands:

- \cventry
- \firstname
- \familyname
  
  
This is a forked project from:
