Dear Greenheart Games,\\[0.5em]
%
Please accept this letter and the attached Curriculum Vitae as my application for the role of Game Developer advertised on your Website.

I believe that, with my skills, experience and attitudes, I could bring a lot to the company, I fulfil all the requirements and I am excited about the prospect. My background --- experience of 7 years --- is focused on the Front-end side and I hope to develop my career further within an important agency as Booking.com working with other skilled and prepared developers.

I am proficient using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Jquery and Mootools), PHP and Ruby on Rails. \\
Currently I have been working for 8 months in Fitmo BV (\url{http://fitmo.com} ) based in Amsterdam, involved in the Front-end side, creating and rendering every Web page from the proper mockups, adding animations and effects using JavaScript and CSS3 features, and working closely with the back-end developers and designers within the company.

In my previous job I have worked for more than 3 years as both Designer and Front-end developer therefore I have excellent knowledge and experience of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator as well. I developed several projects for regional and municipal public administration Web sites, and as the only Front-end developer I built and followed all the works.

I was involved building custom interfaces, CMS, Web portals, Web applications and the clients were always impressed with my diplomacy skills and the way I was able to communicate to find out exactly what they wanted, and then bring the planned vision to life, working under their constant pressure.

W3C standards, SEO and capabilities of different Web browsers are factors I always keep in mind while designing and developing Web applications and my referees can speak for my excellent coding standards.

I enjoy working in a team. I regularly volunteer some time to an italian journalist for his mobile and Web blog.

Some of my personal and professional projects are available on my website at \url{http://matteoborgato.com}.

I am available to come in for an interview at any time, and would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and your staff. I hope that I am granted an opportunity to talk and perhaps meet with you in the very near future. I hope to hear from you soon.
